Repo for the funding service design notification.

Built with Flask.

## Prerequisites

- python ^= 3.10

# Getting started

## Installation

Clone the repository

### Create a Virtual environment

    python3 -m venv .venv

### Enter the virtual environment

...either macOS using bash:

    source .venv/bin/activate

...or if on Windows using Command Prompt:

    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

### Install dependencies
From the top-level directory enter the command to install pip and the dependencies of the project

    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

NOTE: requirements-dev.txt and requirements.txt are updated using [pip-tools pip-compile](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools)
To update requirements please manually add the dependencies in the .in files (not the requirements.txt files)
Then run:

    pip-compile requirements.in

    pip-compile requirements-dev.in

## How to use
1. Set-up an API KEY that requires to connect with the govuk-notify-service

    Click on the link & follow the instructions to set-up an API KEY.
    https://docs.notifications.service.gov.uk/python.html#api-keys

    Set it as an environment variable e.g.
    `export GOV_NOTIFY_API_KEY="api-key-value"`

    Note: For unit (integration) testing, you also need to set this in `pytest.ini`

2. Enter the virtual environment as described above, then:

    `flask run`

    Note: This service is an internal service so it doesn't have the frontend.

# Run with Gunicorn

In deployed environments the service is run with gunicorn. You can run the service locally with gunicorn to test

First set the FLASK_ENV environment you wish to test eg:

    export FLASK_ENV=dev

Then run gunicorn using the following command:

    gunicorn wsgi:app -c run/gunicorn/local.py

## How to post data for notification service.

Go to relevant service. See example
path: app/notification/magic_link/README.md for

### Build with Paketo

[Pack](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/cli/pack_build/)

[Paketo buildpacks](https://paketo.io/)

```pack build <name your image> --builder paketobuildpacks/builder:base```

Example:

```
[~/work/repos/funding-service-design-notification] pack build paketo-demofsd-app --builder paketobuildpacks/builder:base
***
Successfully built image paketo-demofsd-app
```

You can then use that image with docker to run a container

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --env PORT=8080 --env FLASK_ENV=dev [envs] paketo-demofsd-app
```

`envs` needs to include values for each of:
GOV_NOTIFY_API_KEY
SENTRY_DSN
GITHUB_SHA

```
docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                    PORTS                    NAMES

# Pipelines

Place brief descriptions of Pipelines here

- Deploy to Gov PaaS - This is a simple pipeline to demonstrate capabilities.  Builds, tests and deploys a simple python application to the PaaS for evaluation in Dev and Test Only.

# Testing

This repo comes with a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, if you wish to use this do
the following while in your virtual enviroment:

    pip install pre-commit black

    pre-commit install

Once the above is done you will have autoformatting and pep8 compliance built
into your workflow. You will be notified of any pep8 errors during commits.
